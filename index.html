                "touchdown": "A touchdown is worth 6 points and happens when a team gets the ball into the opponent's end zone (the colored area at each end of the field). After scoring a touchdown, the team can kick for 1 extra point or try a 2-point conversion play.",
                "field goal": "A field goal is worth 3 points. The team kicks the ball through the yellow goalposts from anywhere on the field. Teams often attempt field goals on 4th down when they're close enough but can't get a touchdown.",
                "safety": "A safety is worth 2 points and happens when the defense tackles an offensive player in their own end zone, or when the offense commits certain penalties in their end zone.",

                // Game structure
                "quarters": "A football game has 4 quarters, each lasting 15 minutes of game time. With timeouts, commercial breaks, and clock stoppages, games usually last about 3 hours total.",
                "halftime": "Halftime is a 12-minute break between the 2nd and 3rd quarters. Players rest, coaches make adjustments, and during big games there are often entertainment shows.",
                "overtime": "In overtime, the team that wins the coin toss can choose to receive the ball or defer. If they score a touchdown, they win immediately. If they kick a field goal, the other team gets a chance to match or beat it.",

                // Basic rules
                "first down": "A first down means a team has earned a fresh set of 4 attempts (called 'downs') to advance the ball 10 more yards. Teams must gain 10 yards within 4 plays to keep possession of the ball.",
                "down": "A 'down' is one play attempt. Teams get 4 downs to advance the ball 10 yards. If successful, they get 4 new downs. If they fail, the other team gets the ball.",
                "punt": "Punting usually happens on 4th down when a team doesn't think they can get the 10 yards needed. They kick the ball to the other team, but from much farther away.",

                // Positions
                "quarterback": "The quarterback (QB) is the field general of the offense. They take the snap from the center, decide whether to hand off, throw, or run with the ball. They call plays and are usually the team leader.",
                "running back": "Running backs (RBs) are the main ball carriers. They take handoffs from the quarterback and try to run through or around the defense. They also catch passes and help block.",
                "wide receiver": "Wide receivers (WRs) are the primary pass catchers. They run specific routes and try to get open to catch passes from the quarterback.",

                // Other concepts
                "interception": "An interception happens when a defensive player catches a pass that was intended for an offensive player. When this happens, possession immediately changes to the defense.",
                "fumble": "A fumble occurs when a player loses control of the football. Any player from either team can recover it, and whichever team gets it keeps possession.",
                "sack": "A sack is when the quarterback is tackled behind the line of scrimmage while trying to pass. This results in a loss of yards and uses up a down.",
                "blitz": "A blitz is when the defense sends extra players to rush the quarterback, trying to tackle him quickly before he can throw the ball.",

                // Team info
                "players": "Each team has 11 players on the field at any time. The total roster can have up to 53 players, but only 11 from each team are allowed on the field during any play."
